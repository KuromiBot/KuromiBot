# Warn

:::info

The warn command has absolutely **no** legitimate usecase as-is, so it should **not** be used as a general warn command.

:::

The `/warn` command is a command that provides a fake warning so you can warn your friends for no reasons. It sends a DM to the member warned stating they were warned and the reason. It increases a value in a database for the amount of warnings a user has.

## Usage

The loser option takes the member option, and the reason option takes a string, such as 

`/warn loser:member reason:string`

### Example

`/warn loser:@foo reason:bar`
