# Merge Your Code 

If you have patches you wish to merge to the main KuromiBot repository, or just cool features, we have a GitHub repo, and you can make your own pull request on GitHub by using the Git command line!

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit! (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature)
5. Open a Pull Request
